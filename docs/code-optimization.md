# AIGuardian Code Optimization

The AIGuardian Code Optimization feature provides intelligent code analysis and optimization capabilities to improve your codebase's quality, performance, and maintainability.

## Features

### Duplicate Code Detection

Identifies duplicated code blocks across your project and suggests refactoring opportunities to reduce code duplication. This helps maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and makes your codebase more maintainable.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces code size and complexity
- Makes maintenance easier by centralizing logic
- Improves readability and consistency
- Decreases the risk of bugs when changes are needed

**How It Works:**

1. The detector scans your codebase for code blocks that are similar or identical
2. It analyzes the structure and content of each block, ignoring whitespace and variable names
3. When duplications are found, it calculates metrics like:
   - Number of duplicated lines
   - Number of affected files
   - Potential lines that could be reduced through refactoring
4. The detector generates a detailed report with:
   - Location of duplications (file paths and line numbers)
   - Severity assessment (LOW, MODERATE, HIGH)
   - Specific refactoring suggestions tailored to each duplication pattern

**Interpreting Results:**

- **LOW Duplication**: Minor issues, usually small blocks duplicated in a few places
- **MODERATE Duplication**: Significant duplication that should be addressed
- **HIGH Duplication**: Critical level requiring immediate attention

**Refactoring Strategies:**

1. **Extract Method/Function**: Create a shared function for duplicated code blocks
2. **Create Utility Classes/Modules**: For code used across different components
3. **Function Factories**: Create functions that produce specialized functions
4. **Parameterization**: Replace hardcoded values with parameters
5. **Object Composition**: Use composition instead of duplicating similar objects

**Example Refactoring Patterns:**

```javascript
// BEFORE - Duplication
function processUserData(userData) {
  if (!userData) {
    console.error('User data is required');
    return null;
  }
  
  if (!userData.name) {
    console.error('User name is required');
    return null;
  }
  
  // Process data...
}

function processProductData(productData) {
  if (!productData) {
    console.error('Product data is required');
    return null;
  }
  
  if (!productData.name) {
    console.error('Product name is required');
    return null;
  }
  
  // Process data...
}

// AFTER - Refactored
function validateData(data, type, requiredFields) {
  if (!data) {
    console.error(`${type} data is required`);
    return false;
  }
  
  for (const field of requiredFields) {
    if (!data[field]) {
      console.error(`${type} ${field} is required`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}

function processUserData(userData) {
  if (!validateData(userData, 'User', ['name', 'email'])) {
    return null;
  }
  // Process data...
}

function processProductData(productData) {
  if (!validateData(productData, 'Product', ['name', 'price'])) {
    return null;
  }
  // Process data...
}
```

### Dead Code Elimination

Detects unused functions, variables, and code blocks that can be safely removed from your codebase. This helps keep your project clean and reduces unnecessary complexity.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces codebase size
- Improves code clarity
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Eliminates potential confusion

### Code Formatting

Automatically formats your code according to language-specific best practices and style guidelines. Supports JavaScript/TypeScript with consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.

**Benefits:**

- Ensures consistent code style
- Improves readability
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Makes code reviews more effective

### Complexity Analysis

Analyzes code complexity and identifies overly complex functions or methods that may benefit from refactoring. Provides specific recommendations for simplifying complex code.

**Benefits:**

- Identifies hard-to-maintain code
- Suggests concrete simplification strategies
- Improves code readability and maintainability
- Makes onboarding new developers easier

### Performance Optimization

Analyzes code for potential performance issues and suggests improvements. Identifies inefficient patterns, unnecessary computations, and other performance bottlenecks.

**Benefits:**

- Improves application performance
- Reduces resource usage
- Enhances user experience
- Identifies critical performance bottlenecks

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run all optimization tasks
aiguardian-optimize -a

# Run specific optimization tasks
aiguardian-optimize -t detect-duplicate-code -t eliminate-dead-code

# Dry run (no changes applied)
aiguardian-optimize -d -a

# Run on a specific project path
aiguardian-optimize -p /path/to/project -a

# Get help
aiguardian-optimize -h
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p, --path <path>` | Path to the project directory (default: current directory) |
| `-d, --dry-run` | Run without making any changes |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose logging |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--no-backup` | Skip creating backup before changes |
| `-a, --all` | Run all available optimization tasks |
| `-t, --task <id>` | Run specific task (can be used multiple times) |
| `-h, --help` | Display help message |

### Available Tasks

| Task ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `detect-duplicate-code` | Identify duplicated code blocks across the project |
| `eliminate-dead-code` | Detect and suggest removal of unused code |
| `format-code` | Format code according to best practices |
| `analyze-complexity` | Analyze code complexity and provide simplification recommendations |
| `optimize-performance` | Analyze code for performance issues and suggest improvements |

## Optimization Reports

After running optimization tasks, AIGuardian generates a comprehensive report that includes:

1. **Summary of findings** - Overview of issues found and potential improvements
2. **Detailed analysis** - Specific issues with file locations and line numbers
3. **Top recommendations** - Prioritized list of suggested improvements
4. **Metrics** - Quantitative measures of potential improvements

Reports are saved in the project directory and can be used as a guide for improving your codebase.

## Best Practices

1. **Always review changes** - Use the dry-run option (`-d`) to preview changes before applying them
2. **Create backups** - AIGuardian creates backups by default, but you can also make your own
3. **Start small** - Begin with specific tasks rather than running all optimizations at once
4. **Combine with testing** - Run your test suite after applying optimizations to ensure functionality
5. **Commit frequently** - Make small, incremental changes and commit after each successful optimization

## Integration with Development Workflow

For the best results, integrate AIGuardian's code optimization into your development workflow:

1. **Pre-commit** - Run optimization tasks before committing code
2. **Code reviews** - Use optimization reports during code reviews
3. **Continuous integration** - Add optimization checks to your CI pipeline
4. **Regular maintenance** - Schedule periodic optimization runs for ongoing codebase health

## Supported Languages

The optimization features support multiple languages with varying levels of capability:

| Language | Duplicate Detection | Dead Code | Formatting | Complexity | Performance |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Other | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Note: Support for additional languages is continuously being improved.
